# Why Boto3?
# Dynamic Automation: Useful when AWS actions depend on runtime conditions or complex logic.
# Integration: Embeds AWS operations into Python applications (e.g., process data and upload to S3 in one script).
# Choose Boto3 when you need programmatic flexibility; Terraform for repeatable, declarative infrastructure setup; and AWS CLI for quick tasks.
